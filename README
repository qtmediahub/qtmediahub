This is the unified Qt Media Hub repository.

The core repository and the skins are just git submodules.

All the following commands are run in the toplevel dir, where this document
resides

Get the ball rolling with:

git submodule init
git submodule update

(Also do this every time another submodule is added)

Keep up to date with the current known good state:

git fetch
git checkout master
git rebase origin/master
git submodule update

Please note your branches will be checked out to a certain sha1, and hence
will be floating.

You can check out any tag (run: git tag for list of tags) and enact it with:

git checkout tagname
git submodule update

Those wanting to track master on all submodules can use the following
devastating script at their own risk:

danger-boom-no-leg-rough-n-ready-dev-sync

or roll their own if they are fascist
