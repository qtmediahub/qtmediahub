This is the unified Qt Media Hub repository.

The core repository and the skins are just git submodules.

All the following commands are run in the toplevel dir, where this document
resides

Get the ball rolling with:

git submodule init
git submodule update
(Also do this every time another submodule is added)

git submodule foreach git checkout master

Now you have all the source code in place and are able to build the project:

qmake
qmake (you have to run qmake twice, until we have a configure script)
make

(for more details about Qt version and Qt Mobility, see QT-BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS)

Keep up to date with the current known good state:

git fetch
git checkout master
git rebase origin/master
git submodule update

git submodule foreach git fetch
git submodule foreach git checkout master
git submodule foreach git rebase origin/master

Please note your branches will be checked out to a certain sha1, and hence
will be floating.

You can check out any tag (run: git tag for list of tags) and enact it with:

git checkout tagname
git submodule update

Those wanting to track master on all submodules can use the following
devastating script at their own risk:

scripts/sync-to-head

or roll their own
